# allnighter
a simple to do list i made for myself because i work at the nighttime but trello is just too bright and colorful.

## to do (not ordered):
- try working with bootstrap for the UI part
- make tasks editable
- add time management
- implement pomodoro
- add customizable folders for tasks
- make this repository look any better
- try dropping javascript and go for spring boot with database storage for tasks

it's ironic to have a to do list for a to do list app
